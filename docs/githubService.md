# GitHubService Breakdown

This document explains, in simple terms, what each function in the `GitHubService` class does

---

## 1. `constructor(token?)`
**What it does:**
- Sets up the connection to GitHub. If you give it a special password (token), it will use that to access private stuff; otherwise, it just looks at public things.

---

## 2. `fetchRepository(config)`
**What it does:**
- Goes to GitHub and grabs information about a specific repository (like its name, description, and files).
- Gets all the files in the repo (and their contents).
- Uses another function to look through all the files and pick out the ones we care about.
- Gives you a summary of the repo: its name, description, main branch, list of files (with their content), and some stats (like stars and forks).
- If something goes wrong (like the repo doesn't exist), it tells you what the problem was.

---

## 3. `processContents(contents, config)`
**What it does:**
- Looks at a list of files and folders from GitHub.
- If it finds a file, it reads its content and saves it.
- If it finds a folder, it goes inside and repeats the process (like opening a folder to see what's inside).
- Keeps doing this until it has a list of all the files (and their contents) in the whole repo.

---

## 4. `handleError(error)`
**What it does:**
- If something goes wrong while talking to GitHub, this function figures out what the problem was.
- It gives you a simple message and a code (like 404 for "not found").
- If it can't figure out the problem, it just says something went wrong.

---

**In short:**
- The GitHubService connects to GitHub, grabs all the files from a repo, reads their contents, and tells you what it found. If anything goes wrong, it explains the problem in a way that's easy to understand!
