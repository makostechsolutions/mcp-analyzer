# Reflection

## Challenges Faced

One of the main challenges in this project was designing an architecture that is both modular and extensible, while keeping the implementation focused and maintainable. Balancing the need for a clean separation of concerns (UI, parsing, analysis, data fetching) with the time constraints required careful planning. Another challenge was ensuring the parser and analysis logic could handle a variety of code structures, given that real-world MCP server repositories may not always use the expected annotation formats.

A specific challenge arose when testing against the provided MCP server repositories (e.g., Twilio, GitHub, GitLab). Many of these repositories do not contain MCP-annotated code blocks in the format the analyzer expects (e.g., `@tool{...}`), which means the parser returns no results. This is not a limitation of the architecture, but rather a reflection of the diversity in how MCP is implemented across projects. It highlighted the importance of clear documentation and user feedback when no results are found.

## Lessons Learned

- **Architecture First:** Prioritizing architectural planning and documentation made it easier to implement and test key components, and will make future enhancements more straightforward.
- **Explicit Error Handling:** Providing detailed error feedback for invalid or missing MCP blocks improves the user experience and helps with debugging.
- **Testability:** Designing services and core logic to be easily testable (with clear interfaces and mocks) pays off in reliability and maintainability.
- **User Guidance:** It's important to inform users when a repository does not contain MCP-annotated code, to avoid confusion and set expectations.

## Next Steps

- **Analyzer Service:** Refactor the analysis coordination logic into a dedicated analyzer service for better separation of concerns and extensibility.
- **Private Repo Support:** Add authentication and support for private repositories.
- **Enhanced Graph Interactivity:** Implement node click details, edge customization, and more granular validation feedback in the graph.
- **File Browsing:** Allow users to browse and select specific files within a repository for analysis.
- **Community Feedback:** Gather feedback from users and MCP community members to further refine the parser and analysis features.

## Final Thoughts

This project reinforced the value of clear architecture and modular design, especially when working with evolving standards like MCP. While not all test repositories yielded results due to annotation differences, the core architecture is robust and ready to support any repo that follows the MCP annotation standard. The groundwork is laid for future enhancements and broader protocol support.
