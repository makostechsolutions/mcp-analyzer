# Implementation Notes: Plan vs. Actual

## Planned Features & Architecture

- **MCP Parsing:** Extract and validate MCP-annotated blocks (tools, prompts, resources) from code.
- **Repository Integration:** Allow users to analyze GitHub repositories for MCP blocks.
- **Graph Visualization:** Visualize relationships between tools, prompts, and resources.
- **Modern UI:** Use Chakra UI for a clean, responsive interface.
- **Export/Share:** Enable exporting parsed results as JSON.
- **Error Feedback:** Provide detailed error messages for invalid MCP blocks.
- **Service Layer:** Use services for parsing, GitHub integration, and analysis coordination.
- **Testing:** Include unit tests for core logic and services.

## What Was Actually Built

- **MCP Parsing:** Fully implemented with robust validation and error handling. Parser returns detailed errors for invalid blocks.
- **Repository Integration:** Users can analyze public GitHub repositories. The UI uses a tab interface to toggle between code paste and repo input. GitHubService fetches repo metadata and files.
- **Graph Visualization:** Implemented using React Flow. Nodes are color-coded by type, with tooltips on hover. Relationships are visualized as edges.
- **Modern UI:** Chakra UI is used throughout for layout, forms, alerts, and theming. The UI is responsive and user-friendly.
- **Export/Share:** Users can export results as JSON from the results panel.
- **Error Feedback:** Errors are displayed in a detailed alert, listing invalid blocks, their type, file, error message, and content.
- **Service Layer:** All planned services are implemented:
  - Parser service for MCP block extraction and validation
  - GitHub service for repository integration
  - Analyzer service for coordinating parsing, validation, and relationship analysis
- **Testing:** Unit tests are provided for the GitHub service and parser. Tests are located in the `tests` directory.

## Component Structure

- **MCPDemo.tsx:** Main component that orchestrates the analysis workflow
- **MCPGraph.tsx:** Graph visualization component using React Flow
- **MCPResults.tsx:** Results display component showing parsed data and errors
- **RepoOrPasteInput.tsx:** Input component with tab interface for repository URL or code paste

---

## Deviations & Trade-offs

- **Private Repo Support:** Only public GitHub repositories are supported at this stage. Private repo support (with authentication) is a future enhancement.
- **Graph Interactivity:** Basic node hover tooltips are implemented, but advanced features like node click details and edge customization are planned for future versions.
- **File Browsing:** In-repo file browsing is not yet available; the app analyzes all files in the repo root and subdirectories.
- **Validation Feedback:** While error feedback is robust, more granular validation and suggestions could be added.

---

## Additional Features

- **Detailed Error Reporting:** The parser provides granular error messages, including the problematic block content.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** The UI is organized into focused components for better maintainability.
- **Type Safety:** Comprehensive TypeScript types ensure data consistency across the application.
- **Test Repo Guidance:** Users are informed that only MCP-annotated repos will yield results, with guidance on testing.

## Summary
The core goals of the project were met, with a few planned features deferred for future work. The codebase is organized, testable, and ready for further enhancements. The service layer is complete, and the component structure provides a solid foundation for adding new features.
