# Implementation Notes: Plan vs. Actual

## Planned Features & Architecture

- **MCP Parsing:** Extract and validate MCP-annotated blocks (tools, prompts, resources) from code.
- **Repository Integration:** Allow users to analyze GitHub repositories for MCP blocks.
- **Graph Visualization:** Visualize relationships between tools, prompts, and resources.
- **Modern UI:** Use Chakra UI for a clean, responsive interface.
- **Export/Share:** Enable exporting parsed results as JSON.
- **Error Feedback:** Provide detailed error messages for invalid MCP blocks.
- **Service Layer:** Use services for parsing, GitHub integration, and (planned) analysis coordination.
- **Testing:** Include unit tests for core logic and services.

## What Was Actually Built

- **MCP Parsing:** Fully implemented with robust validation and error handling. Parser returns detailed errors for invalid blocks.
- **Repository Integration:** Users can analyze public GitHub repositories. The UI allows toggling between code paste and repo input. GitHubService fetches repo metadata and files.
- **Graph Visualization:** Implemented using React Flow. Nodes are color-coded by type, with tooltips on hover. Relationships are visualized as edges.
- **Modern UI:** Chakra UI is used throughout for layout, forms, alerts, and theming. The UI is responsive and user-friendly.
- **Export/Share:** Users can export results as JSON from the results panel.
- **Error Feedback:** Errors are displayed in a detailed alert, listing invalid blocks, their type, file, error message, and content.
- **Service Layer:** Parser and GitHub services are implemented. An analyzer service is planned but not yet implemented; analysis logic is currently coordinated in the main component.
- **Testing:** Unit tests are provided for the GitHub service and parser. Tests are colocated in `__tests__` folders for clarity.

## Deviations & Trade-offs

- **Analyzer Service:** The dedicated analyzer service was planned to coordinate parsing, validation, and relationship analysis, but this logic is currently handled in the main UI component for simplicity. This can be refactored in the future for better separation of concerns.
- **Private Repo Support:** Only public GitHub repositories are supported at this stage. Private repo support (with authentication) is a future enhancement.
- **Graph Interactivity:** Node click details and advanced edge customization are planned but not yet implemented.
- **File Browsing:** In-repo file browsing is not yet available; the app analyzes all files in the repo root and subdirectories.
- **Validation Feedback:** While error feedback is robust, more granular validation and suggestions could be added.

## Additional Features

- **Detailed Error Reporting:** The parser provides granular error messages, including the problematic block content.
- **UI Refactoring:** The UI was refactored for clarity, with input and results separated into distinct components.
- **Test Repo Guidance:** Users are informed that only MCP-annotated repos will yield results, with guidance on testing.

## Summary
The core goals of the project were met, with a few planned features deferred for future work. The codebase is organized, testable, and ready for further enhancements.
